                The first women's rights convention is held in Seneca Falls, New
                York. There, 68 women and 32 men sign a Declaration of
                Sentiments, which modeled on the Declaration of Independence,
                outlines grievances and sets the agenda for the women's rights
                movement. A set of 12 resolutions is adopted calling for equal
                treatment of women and men under the law and voting rights for
                women.

                Association. The primary goal of the organization is to achieve
                voting rights for women by means of an amendment to the U.S.
                Constitution. Lucy Stone, Henry Blackwell, and others form the
                American Woman Suffrage Association, which focuses exclusively
                on gaining voting rights for women through the individual
                states.

                Victoria Woodhull addresses the Judiciary Committee of the U.S.

              <p>
                The Anti-Suffrage Party is founded. Many people, including
                prominent women, such as Ellen Sherman, wife of General William
                Tecumseh Sherman, challenged the notion of suffrage as a
                “natural right,” and opposed its extension to women. In their
                view, women's political participation threatened their important
                roles as wives, mothers, educators, and philanthropists.

                The Woman Suffrage Amendment, originally written by Susan B.
                Anthony and introduced in Congress in 1878, is passed by the
                House of Representatives and the Senate. It is then sent to the
                states for ratification. Wisconsin and Illinois are the first
                states to ratify.
